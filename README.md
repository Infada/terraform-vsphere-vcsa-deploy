# VMware VCSA Module

This repo contains a set of modules for deploying a [VMware VCSA](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.vcsa.doc/GUID-223C2821-BD98-4C7A-936B-7DBE96291BA4.html) virtual center on a
[VMware](https://www.vmware.com/) hypervisor using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

The vCenter Server Appliance is a preconfigured Linux virtual machine, which is optimized for running VMware vCenter ServerÂ® and the associated services on Linux.

This Module uses the [VMware VCSA](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/products/vCenter/vmw-datasheetvcenter.pdf) as a deployment artifact.

## How do you use this Module?

This repo has the following structure:

* [test](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-vault/tree/master/test): Automated tests for the modules and examples.
* [root folder](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-vault/tree/master): The root folder is *an example* of how to use the [vault-cluster module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-vault/tree/master/modules/vault-cluster)
  module to deploy a [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) cluster in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). The Terraform Registry requires the root of every repo to contain Terraform code, so we've put one of the examples there. This example is great for learning and experimenting, but for production use, please use the underlying modules in the [modules folder](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-vault/tree/master/modules) directly.

## What's a Module?

A Module is a canonical, reusable, best-practices definition for how to run a single piece of infrastructure, such
as a database or server cluster. Each Module is created primarily using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/),
includes automated tests, examples, and documentation, and is maintained both by the open source community and
companies that provide commercial support.

Instead of having to figure out the details of how to run a piece of infrastructure from scratch, you can reuse
existing code that has been proven in production. And instead of maintaining all that infrastructure code yourself,
you can leverage the work of the Module community and maintainers, and pick up infrastructure improvements through
a version number bump.



## Who maintains this Module?

This Module is maintained by [River Point Technology](http://www.riverpointtechnology.com/). If you're looking for help or commercial
support, send an email to [info@riverpointtechnology.com](mailto:info@riverpointtechnology.com?Subject=ESXi%20Module).
River Point Technology can help with:

* Setup, customization, and support for this Module.
* Modules for other types of infrastructure, such as vSphere, NSX-T, AWS, Azure, GCP and continuous integration.
* Consulting & Training on VMware, AWS, Terraform, Vault and DevOps.


## How is this Module versioned?

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release,
along with the changelog, in the [Releases Page](../../releases).

During initial development, the major version will be 0 (e.g., `0.x.y`), which indicates the code does not yet have a
stable API. Once we hit `1.0.0`, we will make every effort to maintain a backwards compatible API and use the MAJOR,
MINOR, and PATCH versions on each release to indicate any incompatibilities.
